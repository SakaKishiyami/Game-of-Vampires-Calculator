[33ma8cde64[m Rewrite inventory matching to use known grid structure - Replace complex edge detection with simple 5-column grid approach - Ignore bottom 1/4 of image as specified - Match each grid cell directly against GoV assets - This should finally match the items correctly in the inventory grid
[33m46f826a[m Fix count extraction to look at bottom right corner - Extract count numbers from bottom right corner of each matched region - Use brightness ratio to estimate count values - This should correctly read the numbers in the bottom right of each item square
[33m946d55e[m Fix image matching for transparent assets vs colored backgrounds - Only compare non-transparent pixels from GoV assets against inventory screenshots - Lower confidence threshold from 0.4 to 0.2 for more aggressive matching - Relax region detection filters to find more item-like regions - This should fix matching transparent PNG assets against colored inventory backgrounds
[33m9212aec[m Fix GoVAssets folder structure and ensure all assets are accessible - Move assets from nested GoVAssets/GoVAssets/ to public/GoVAssets/ - Copy all 255 assets from src/data/GoVAssets to public/GoVAssets - Fix 404 errors for asset loading in production
